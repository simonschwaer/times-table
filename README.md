# Times Table Canvas

This is a simple implementation for the "times table graphs" explained [here (YT)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhbuKbxJsk8).

## JS Structure

There is a little jQuery plugin located in `js/components`, which does the calculation and draws the graph in an existing canvas.
The rest of the magic (e.g. animation, colors, responsiveness, user interface) can be found in the `main.js`.
